In SQL, a common yet subtle error arises when using `ORDER BY` with `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses without proper indexing.  Consider this scenario:

```sql
SELECT * FROM large_table ORDER BY columnA LIMIT 10 OFFSET 1000;
```

If `columnA` lacks an index, the database must perform a full table scan to sort the entire table before applying `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`.  This is incredibly inefficient for large tables, leading to slow query performance. The same issue applies to `ROW_NUMBER()` which can also cause a table scan if not used efficiently.

Another less common, but equally problematic error involves implicit type conversions within `WHERE` clauses. If a column's data type doesn't match the type of a value used in comparison, unexpected results can occur. SQL might perform an implicit conversion that alters the meaning of the comparison in ways that are not immediately obvious.

For example, if `columnB` is a string and you use:

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE columnB = 123;
```

SQL might implicitly convert `123` to a string, but the result will be surprising if you have strings like "0123" or "123a" in your data.  Explicit type casting can help to avoid such pitfalls.
